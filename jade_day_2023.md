      <td>The Hartree Centre presentation will cover operational highlights and reflections and will highlight a future direction for UKRI AI services. I’m keen that our technology partnerships reflect our strategic priorities. I’m very proud that the Hartree Centre is a partner in the JADE Tier-2 centre. A centre that has shown the UK the direction for future accelerated AI services targeting both academic research and industry.</td>

      <td>Professor Nowotny is the Co-Investigator of the JADE2 consortium at the University of Sussex. But he is also involved in using JADE2 for his own research in bio-mimetic AI. The project is concerned with gradient-based learning in spiking neural networks with the EventProp algorithm, introduced by Pehle and Wunderlich in 2021. We have found that applying EventProp to certain classification problems in spiking neural networks requires extensions to the algorithm and careful adjustments in the form of regularisation. The use of JADE2 (and other HPC systems) has been instrumental in investigating the necessary adjustments and finding the all-important correct meta-parameter values.</td>

      <td>Dr. Adam Grzywaczewski is a senior deep learning data scientist / solution architect at NVIDIA, where his primary responsibility is to support customers in scaling and deployment of their deep learning workloads.
NVIDIA has laid the computational foundations for the modern AI revolution. Not only have we designed the GPUs that power the JADE supercomputer but also have created JADE server designed pushing the boundaries of scale in AI and creating tools that were critical for the current AI revolution. We have also worked with the entire AI community developing open software that today makes problems that seemed unimageable just few years ago (like building models composed of hundreds of billions of parameters) easy. NVIDIA has worked closely to help bring up JADE systems and enable its community to push the scientific boundary.</td>
