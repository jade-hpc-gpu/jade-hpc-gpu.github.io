## Requesting an account

For information on requesting an account on JADE please follow the link below: 

[Getting an account — JADE documentation](https://jade-arc-docs.readthedocs.io/jade/getting-account.html)

This link covers how to apply for a Hartree SAFE account, a JADE project account and a Hartree “ServiceNow” account (Hartree’s self-service customer portal). Please note access to ServiceNow will only be provided after the user has registered within SAFE and joined a project.

Please be aware, access to these systems and projects is not automatically approved. Project membership approval is completed by the project’s PI or PM. Hartree is responsible for account provisioning, but only once the project’s PI/PM has approved project membership and has added the user to one or more project groups.

## Generating SSH Keys

Information on generating SSH keys is detailed below: 

[Generating SSH Keys](https://jade-arc-docs.readthedocs.io/jade/connecting.html#generating-ssh-keys)

You will need to provide your SSH public key as part of your SAFE account registration process (you must never share your private key with anybody). Please note that new or updated SSH keys are deployed to the respective user account by Hartree during business hours, only.

Accounts pending SSH key availability will result in reminders sent at 1, 2- and 3-week intervals. After a period of 4 weeks pending, due to a missing key, the request for the account will be declined.

For technical queries about software/drivers please use the [GitHub Issue tracker.](https://github.com/jade-hpc-gpu/jade-hpc-gpu.github.io/issues)

## Service availability

For information on service availability, including scheduled maintenance, then please follow the link below to the Hartree Centre’s status page: 

[Hartree Services Status - Hartree Centre Customer Portal (service-now.com)](https://stfc.service-now.com/hcssp?id=services_status)

Hartree Centre scheduled maintenance occurs on the first and third Wednesday of each month. When specific packages of maintenance work are scheduled on these days, an announcement will be made via e-mail (subject to users having chosen not to opt out of informational e-mails) and the Hartree Centre Status Page will be updated accordingly.

## Do the compute nodes have direct access to the Internet?

No, and this is a design and implementation decision for the service and not one that will be changed. Please refer to your local RSE or the community support pages, in the first instance, if you require more information or support regarding approaches to working with this constraint.
